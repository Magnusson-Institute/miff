_ .. hmm, I had a warning to myself "Do *not* run "brew install mercurial", that's something else, it will
drag in newer versions of Python (3.9.x) etc" that I'm "now" ignoring (Dec 21) .. _


# TODO (informal section - will migrate to issues)

* [PSM 07/05]: need to update
``locales/en-US/toolkit/about/aboutRights.ftl`` to correctly
position MiFF, including referencing our privacy policy. need
to document what policy documents somebody *else* who
works with ``miff`` would need to change.

* [PSM 07/05]: these need to be changed to 'miff-help':

```
        browser/base/content/aboutDialog.xhtml
   130	<label is="text-link" onclick="openHelpLink('firefox-help')" data-l10n-id="aboutdialog-help-user"/>
        browser/base/content/browser-menubar.inc
   467	oncommand="openHelpLink('firefox-help')"
        browser/base/content/browser.js
   2601	openHelpLink("firefox-help");
```

and a matching ``privacy.app/supportmiff-help`` endpoint added (i think that's where they'll go,
thought right now it looks like still landing on ``https://privacy.app/supportfirefox-help``)

* [PSM 07/05]: i _think_ we should replace all occurrences of
  "mozilla.org" or "firefox.com" to "privacy.app" in file
  ``source/browser/app/profile/firefox.js``; note that many have already been
  modified with "MagIns" explanations.

* [PSM 07/05]: need an endpoint for ``https://privacy.app/contribute/``

* [PSM 07/05]: i am currently experimenting with using these additional lines in the "mozconfig" file:


```
   # this fixes -DMOZ_DISTRIBUTION_ID="org.mozilla"
   ac_add_options --with-distribution-id=app.privacy

   # this fixes -DMOZ_MACBUNDLE_ID=org.mozilla.nightly
   ac_add_options --with-macbundlename-prefix=app.privacy

   # this might help:
   ac_add_options --with-branding=browser/branding/unofficial






   # unsure if this needs fixing? -DMOZ_USER_DIR="Mozilla" 
```

as well as one change, and one addition, to "browser/branding/unofficial/configure.sh":

  
```
   #MOZ_APP_DISPLAYNAME=Nightly
   # MagIns - changed
   MOZ_APP_DISPLAYNAME=Miff
   # MagIns - added, not sure (yet) if it makes much difference:
   MOZ_APP_VENDOR=PrivacyApp
```

they might help on a Mac (or Mobile) build.
